# simple_testing
This is intended to be used a git submodule to emulate installation of the plugin.

Only contains the files needed to install the plugin. The main `simple-testing-godot` repository contains the entire Godot 4 project.

Currently this repo is what I'm using for quickly iterating on development of the plugin, its state is not the same as that of the main repo.
